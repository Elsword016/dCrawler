# dCrawler
dCrawler is a fully independent clustering algorithm that only requires a distance threshold (Th(d)) to perform clustering

## Requirements
For now only a MATLAB version of the algortihm is provided.
We have tested this on MATLAB versions 2020 and above and no additional libraries are required

## Installation
Once the codes have been downloaded onto your PC simply add the file paths to your MATLAB environment (home tab, environment section, click on the button "Set Path") and then you should be good to go!

## Use
There are two versions of dCrawler provided here.
<mnl_Basic_dCrawler> - This is the simplest purest form of the crawler. Simply insert your values as the "InputMatrix"
